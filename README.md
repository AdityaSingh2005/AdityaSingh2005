I am a Full-Stack AI Engineer passionate about building intelligent, scalable, and user-focused applications by combining AI/ML, LLMs, and automation with modern full-stack technologies like Python, JavaScript/TypeScript. Skilled in deep learning, NLP, vector databases, and semantic search, I enjoy exploring how AI can transform workflows, make accurate predictions, and solve complex real-world problems. With strong experience in databases, cloud deployment, and CI/CD pipelines.

As a side quest, I founded Geek Room, a 1,00,000+ developer community that connects students across India through hackathons, workshops, and bootcamps, fostering growth and collaboration. Driven by curiosity and creativity, I thrive on learning, experimenting, and bringing impactful ideas to life at the intersection of AI innovation, product development, and community building ✨
