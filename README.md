## 👋 About Me

I’m a **Software Engineer focused on AI-powered backend systems** that operate on messy, real-world data.  
I build production-grade pipelines that combine **LLMs, NLP, distributed queues, and cloud infrastructure** to solve problems where correctness, scale, and automation actually matter.

Currently working at **Bynd AI**, building AI systems for **financial data extraction, intelligence, and research automation**. Previously worked in **legal-tech** and **AI-driven design automation**.

I like systems that:
- break at scale (so I can fix them properly),
- replace manual workflows,
- and ship with measurable impact.
